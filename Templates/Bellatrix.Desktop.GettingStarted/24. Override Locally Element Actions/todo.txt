1. Open the tests that you made in the page objects section
2. For the whole test run override the Button control behaviour of IsDisabled property
3. Open the modified tests and override the same Button behaviour but this time locally, change how you check whether the button is disabled
4. Execute the test and see which override is called the local or the global one
